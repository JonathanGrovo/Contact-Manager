all of the login and registration functionalities are handled here. if you plan on expanding, i ask that you try to keep the theme consistent with what those pages have.

it would probably be easiest to use some of the styling i already have in the login.css page.

currently, main.php does not support full crud, goal is to have that done by this friday
