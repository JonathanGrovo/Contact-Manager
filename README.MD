This is a contact manager application that allows users to either login if they have an existing account or
sign up if they are new to the site. Once signed in, the user can create, read, update, and delete contacts, wherein the contacts
have fields corresponding to their first and last names, email address, and phone number. Additionally, the day that the contact was created
displays next to the contact. The user search through the contacts based on any of their input fields. Contacts are limited in terms of the characters
that can exist in their fields, such as their names being required to only consist of characters in the alphabet.
