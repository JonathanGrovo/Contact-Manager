# Contact Manager

This is a contact management application that enables users to manage their contacts efficiently. Users can sign in with an existing account or register as new users. Once authenticated, users can create, view, update, and delete contacts. Each contact includes fields for first name, last name, email address, and phone number. The application also displays the creation date of each contact and offers a search functionality to filter contacts based on any input field. Input validation ensures that names consist only of alphabetic characters.
